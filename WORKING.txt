# Import repairs table (from source) into Google Fusion tables (use personal Gmail)
#   change DEVELOPMENT NAME, ADDRESS, REPAIR CATEGORY, ITEM DETAIL to type > text
# With buildings
#   create full_address field by adding state in G and using =CONCATENATE(A2, ", ", B2, ", ", C2)
#   import into google docs
#   and geocode the buildings table with https://github.com/mapbox/geo-googledocs
#   import into Fusion tables
